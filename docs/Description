The WildGuard system uses the Infineon PSoC™ 6 AI Evaluation Kit (CY8CKIT-062S2-AI) as its core hardware, with all sensors (MEMS microphone IM72D128, IMU Bosch BMI-270/BMM-350, barometric pressure sensor DPS368, and Wi-Fi/BLE module Murata LBEE5KL1YN) integrated on the board, requiring no external sensor connections. Power is supplied by a 3.7V LiPo battery (1000mAh) connected to the kit’s VIN (5V-tolerant) and GND pins via a TP4056 charger module for remote operation. A USB-C cable connects the kit to a Windows PC for initial programming and firmware updates. The schematic is minimal, as the PSoC™ 6 AI Kit’s onboard components handle all data collection and processing, with the battery and charger ensuring field deployment.

>> Components 
1. PSoC™ 6 AI Evaluation Kit (CY8CKIT-062S2-AI): Core board with MCU, sensors, and connectivity.
2. 3.7V LiPo Battery (1000mAh): Power source for remote operation.
3. TP4056 Charger Module: Manages battery charging via USB-C.
4. Connecting Wires: 22–26 AWG wires for power connections.
5. USB-C Cable: For programming and firmware updates.

>> Notes 
Power Connections: The TP4056 ensures safe battery charging/discharging. The PSoC™ 6 AI Kit’s VIN pin accepts 3.3V–5V, compatible with the 3.7V LiPo.
Onboard Sensors: All sensors are pre-integrated, requiring no additional wiring.
Programming: The USB-C cable connects to a Windows PC for flashing firmware via ModusToolbox™ Programmer.
References: Refer the PSoC™ 6 AI Kit User Guide attached for pinout details and power requirements.

Future Improvements :
1. Add a switch between the battery and TP4056 for power control.
2. Include a solar panel (e.g., 5V 200mA) for sustainable charging, wired to the TP4056 input.
